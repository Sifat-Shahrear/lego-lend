📈 **Interest Rate Model:** Implements an innovative interest rate model to ensure fair and competitive borrowing rates.

🏦 **Lending:** Provides a platform for users to lend their assets and earn passive income through interest payments.

🔮 **Oracles:** Integrates with oracle services to provide accurate pricing data for assets and ensure the stability of the protocol.

🦀 **Rust:** Written in Rust, a powerful and efficient programming language perfect for building high-performance blockchain applications.

🌐 **Solana & SPL:** Fully integrated with Solana blockchain and SPL token standard for seamless interoperability with other projects.
